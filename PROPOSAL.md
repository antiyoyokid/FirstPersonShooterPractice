# Project Proposal
So, for this project I am planning to use the GoDot engine to create an Android / Windows game where the user has to dodge incoming obstacles falling down on the player. The player will have the option to tilt the screen or press the arrow keys to move the character and dodge the falling objects. The android game will be complete with proper UI, like a main menu.
