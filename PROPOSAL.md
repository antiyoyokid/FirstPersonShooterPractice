# Project Proposal
For this project my aim is to create a Shooting Range using C++ and UNREAL ENGINE. During the development process, I plan to avoid using BluePrinting and do as much as I can on C++. The idea behind the shooting range is that it will help a lot of people especially gamers not only get better mouse control but also improve their aiming and accuracy. 

I will have moving objects and the player can move around and shoot these objects. The speed of the movement of the objects will also increase over time. The entire game will be a first person shooter. This means that I must have proper player movements with the WASD keys, the ability to look around using the mouse and the ability to shoot when I click the mouse. I also plan to create an element of surprise where objects will suddenly appear, so that the game does not seem reptitive and will challenge everyone who plays it.
